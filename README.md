Corundum
========

Description
=========
This project is a Java-based server-side plugin-based modification A.P.I. for Minecraft. Using Mojang's minecraft_server.jar as a resource, it can work like a Minecraft server while allowing user-programmed Java plugins to handle events that occur during the gameplay in order to modify the mechanics of Minecraft. This can be used to do small tasks like preventing the spawning of baby zombies or large, complex tasks such as creating minigames servers like MinePlex, The Shotbow Network, or HyPixel's server.
